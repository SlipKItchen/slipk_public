🚀 Early Access for a Tool I Built for Tipsters Like You

Body (Email/WhatsApp):

Hey [Name],

Hope you're doing great!

I’ve been building a web app called SlipKitchen — it’s designed specifically for people like you who take football betting seriously.

As someone who's been around tipsters, I noticed a common pattern: we plan our slips on paper, Notes apps, or Excel — and forget important assumptions, lose track of past mistakes, or miss patterns. SlipKitchen is here to fix that.

🔧 What it does:

Lets you write, save, and edit prediction slips — with reasoning & confidence level

Lets you track wins/losses and assumptions for each slip

Lets you blacklist or whitelist teams that mess you up or win for you

Export your slips to PDF and share with followers (great for pro tipsters)

I'm currently inviting a few serious bettors and tipsters to test the MVP and give some feedback.

💡 What’s in it for you:

Early access before launch

Direct influence on shaping features

Option to become an official partner/affiliate when the paid version drops — earn from referrals

If you're interested, just fill this quick 1-min form:
👉 [Insert Google Form Link]
https://forms.gle/GjhEZ54JngPTG9FZ7

Once you submit, I’ll share the app link and how to test it.

Thanks for reading, and I’d genuinely value your insights on this!

Best,
Nesh (SlipKitchen)

✅ Tips for Use:
For WhatsApp, keep it friendly and break the message into small chunks.

Example:

Hello There.  
Been building a tool I think you'll like.  
It’s called SlipKitchen – helps you plan & track betting slips smarter (reasoning, blacklist teams, performance etc)

Quick question – mind testing it for me? I’m giving early access to just a few solid tipsters I trust 🙏🏽

You’ll also be able to earn from it later if you want to promote.
